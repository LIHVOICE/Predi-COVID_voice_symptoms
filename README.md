# A Voice-based Biomarker For Monitoring Symptom Resolution In Adults With COVID-19
## Background
People with COVID-19 may experience impairing, and sometimes persisting, symptoms that would require enhanced surveillance. Our objective was to train an artificial intelligence-based model to predict the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and derive a digital vocal biomarker for easily and quantitatively monitoring symptom resolution.
